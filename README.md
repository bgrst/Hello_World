Hello World :)

There is no contradiction in a freewill issue. 

There are computers and there are servers.
What is the difference? What feature makes pc a server? 
SOFT - THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE                   
PC by itself can be small or big, powerfull or not, it can be turned into server only with special soft. Sometimes people buy hard components according to requirments of future server, later they upgrade, if needed, if crash reports, out of order or needs to be repaired. By analogy. Why not run server app "soul" or "conciosness" on the hard taken from gorillas? Apps influenced the physical upgrade of the mankind. But the Owner (or Sysadmin) is the One who decides future config of both material and nonmaterial components of every pc (should it be server or not), basic features usually remain through life (like skin color), but IT IS possible to influence your physical upgrade, just keep asking, and it will be given.
